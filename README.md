# Latin-Reconstruction-NAACL

A Romance cognate dataset described in the paper "[Ab Antiquo: Neural Proto-language Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.02477.pdf)" (accepted in NACL 2021).

The dataset was automatically transcribed to IPA, and contains Latin vowel lengths.

The complete dataset, based on Ciobanu and Dinu (2014b), is not publicly available, and may be provided by request. Here, we publish the entires which we added to the original dataset.
